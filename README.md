# TO-DO


## Phase 1 ~ 

In this initial phase, we’re going to have to start by converting a legacy application into a more modern architecture. Our initial “Proof of Concept” was written using class based components and was not properly styled. Now that our client has given us the “green light” for development, we’re going to refactor the application using Hooks and upgrading the style.

**The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.**

- As a user, I would like an easy way to add a new to do item using an online interface
- As a user, I would like my to do items to have an assignee, due date, difficulty meter, status and the task itself
- As a user, I would like to delete to do items that are no longer needed
- As a user, I would like to easily mark to do items as completed
- As a user, I would like to edit an existing to do item

## Phase 2 ~ 

In Phase 2, we’re going to connect the To Do Manager to a deployed API, backed by a database. The core functionality and stories do not change (reference Phase 1), but a new one has been added to note this shift in persistence.

**The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.**

- As a user, I would like to be able to add, update, and delete To Do items
- As a user, I would like my To Do Items to be permanently stored so that I can re-access them at any time, using any device
