# TO-DO


## Phase 2 ~ 

In Phase 2, weâ€™re going to connect the To Do Manager to a deployed API, backed by a database. The core functionality and stories do not change (reference Phase 1), but a new one has been added to note this shift in persistence.

**The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.**

- As a user, I would like to be able to add, update, and delete To Do items
- As a user, I would like my To Do Items to be permanently stored so that I can re-access them at any time, using any device
